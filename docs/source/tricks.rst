* `The TFTS BERT model <https://github.com/LongxingTan/KDDCup2022-Baidu>`_ wins the 3rd place in `Baidu KDD Cup 2022 <https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/introduction>`_
* `The TFTS Seq2Seq mode <https://github.com/LongxingTan/Data-competitions/tree/master/tianchi-enso-prediction>`_ wins the 4th place of `Tianchi ENSO prediction <https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531871/introduction>`_
